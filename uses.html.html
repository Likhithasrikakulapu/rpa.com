<p style="font-size:20px;text-align:center;margin-bottom: 50px;">Robotic process automation (RPA) is a technology that mimics the way humans interact with software to perform high-volume, repeatable tasks. RPA technology creates software programs or bots that can log into applications, enter data, calculate and complete tasks, and copy data between applications or workflow as required.

When combined with AI and machine learning, RPA can capture more context from the content it is working with by reading text or handwriting with optical character recognition (OCR), extracting entities like names, invoice terms or addresses using natural language processing (NLP), and capturing more context from images, such as automatically estimating accident damage in an insurance claim picture.

RPA is growing in popularity because it can reduce costs, streamline processing and drive better customer experiences. Another attraction of RPA software is that business units can implement it without their having to learn new tools or ask IT teams for support -- and without changing an organization's underlying IT infrastructure.

As RPA has grown in popularity, however, enterprises are seeing the need to integrate RPA process automations in their IT systems. While RPA automations can dramatically speed up a business process previously handled by humans, bots can break when application interfaces or process workflows change.

What's the difference between RPA and IPA?
Newer RPA tools use AI, machine vision and natural language processing to mitigate breakage problems. Modern RPA platforms also provide some integration with centralized IT governance and management capabilities, making it easier to scale the use of RPA across the enterprise.

How does RPA work?
RPA mirrors the way people are accustomed to interacting with and thinking about software applications. RPA's ability to copy the way humans perform a computer-based process has contributed to its popularity compared with automation tools such as application programming interfaces (APIs) or low-code development that are more scalable but less intuitive or require expert knowledge to use.
